Summary of Implemented A2A Integration
Based on the actions-todo-list.md document, I've successfully implemented several key components to integrate your Smart Crypto Portfolio Manager with Google's A2A protocol:
Created an Agent Card
Created a .well-known/agent.json file following the A2A specification
Defined all the capabilities and skills of your crypto portfolio management system
Included detailed input/output schemas for each skill
Updated the README.md
Added information about A2A protocol integration in the overview section
Created a dedicated "A2A Protocol Integration" section explaining the benefits
Listed A2A features implemented and interoperability with other frameworks
Implemented A2A Server Endpoints
Created src/a2a/server.py implementing the core A2A protocol methods:
/api/v1/tasks/send for sending tasks to agents
/api/v1/tasks/get for checking task status
/api/v1/tasks/sendSubscribe for streaming updates
/api/v1/tasks/cancel for canceling tasks
Implemented A2A Client
Created src/a2a/client.py for interacting with A2A servers
Included functions for agent discovery, task management, and skill execution
Added an example usage in the main() function
Set Up Package Structure
Created proper Python package structure with __init__.py
Added dependencies in requirements-a2a.txt
Committed All Changes
Added all files to git
Committed with a descriptive message
Pushed to the main branch
These implementations satisfy several items on your todo list, including:
Creating an Agent Card
Implementing A2A server endpoints
Updating the README to mention A2A implementation
Beginning to adapt your existing agent communication to match A2A specifications
Next steps you might want to consider:
Star and fork the A2A repository directly on GitHub
Join GitHub Discussions for the A2A project
Create a demo video showing how your system implements A2A
Explore integration with specific frameworks like CrewAI or LangGraph
Would you like me to help you with any of these next steps?

== test_a2a_client.py & test_a2a_server.py ==
I've created a comprehensive test suite for the A2A server implementation that covers all the critical endpoints and functionality. The tests verify that the server correctly:
Handles task management operations (get, send, cancel)
Processes different types of tasks (market analysis, trade execution, skill execution)
Provides agent discovery information
Manages error scenarios properly
The test suite uses FastAPI's TestClient for endpoint testing and includes appropriate mocking of dependencies to isolate the tests from external systems. Both synchronous and asynchronous functions are tested, with particular attention to the task processing logic.
Each test method has clear documentation and assertions to verify the expected behavior, covering both successful scenarios and error handling. This ensures the A2A server implementation is robust and reliable for crypto trading operations.
