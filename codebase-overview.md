● This is a cryptocurrency portfolio management system using a multi-agent architecture:

  1. Core Agents:
    - Market Analysis: Analyzes trends and opportunities
    - Trade Execution: Handles buy/sell orders on exchanges
    - Risk Management: Monitors portfolio risk
    - Reporting Analytics: Generates performance reports
    - Orchestration: Coordinates all other agents
  2. Communication Protocols:
    - Agent-to-Agent (A2A): For inter-agent communication
    - Machine-Callable Protocol (MCP): For external system integration
  3. Key Workflows:
    - Crypto order processing
    - Portfolio optimization and rebalancing
    - Market analysis and monitoring
  4. Technology Stack:
    - Python/FastAPI for agent implementation
    - Docker for containerized deployment
    - Async programming for efficient task handling

  The system uses a microservices approach where specialized agents communicate through standardized protocols to manage
  cryptocurrency portfolios autonomously.
