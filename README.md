# Smart Crypto Portfolio Manager

A sophisticated multi-agent system for intelligent cryptocurrency portfolio management using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol.

## Overview

The Smart Crypto Portfolio Manager is a modular and extensible system that leverages multiple specialized AI agents to automate and optimize cryptocurrency trading. Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of trading, and they communicate with each other through a standardized A2A protocol.

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Smart+Crypto+Portfolio+Manager+Architecture)

The system consists of four main agents:

1. **Market Analysis Agent**: Monitors crypto markets, analyzes trends, and identifies trading opportunities.
2. **Trade Execution Agent**: Executes buy/sell orders on various crypto exchanges.
3. **Risk Management Agent**: Monitors portfolio risk exposure and suggests risk mitigation actions.
4. **Reporting and Analytics Agent**: Generates reports on trading performance and portfolio valuation.

### Agent Communication

Agents communicate using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, which provides:

- Agent discovery through agent cards (JSON files describing capabilities)
- Task-based interaction model
- Structured JSON messages
- Secure and reliable communication

## Use Cases

### Automated Trading Strategy Execution

The Market Analysis Agent continuously monitors crypto markets and identifies trading opportunities based on technical analysis, trend detection, and pattern recognition. When it identifies a potential trade, it:

1. Requests a risk assessment from the Risk Management Agent
2. If the risk is acceptable, sends a trade execution request to the Trade Execution Agent
3. Notifies the Reporting and Analytics Agent about the trade
4. Monitors the trade and adjusts strategy as needed

### Risk Management and Portfolio Optimization

The Risk Management Agent continuously evaluates the overall portfolio risk and can:

1. Set stop-loss and take-profit levels for active positions
2. Recommend portfolio rebalancing when asset allocations drift
3. Trigger emergency protocols during market crashes
4. Impose limits on trade sizes based on risk metrics

### Performance Tracking and Reporting

The Reporting and Analytics Agent automatically generates reports on:

1. Daily, weekly, and monthly trading performance
2. Portfolio valuation and asset allocation
3. Risk metrics and exposure analysis
4. Trade statistics and execution quality

### Custom Strategy Development

The modular nature of the system enables easy development of custom trading strategies:

1. Implement new technical indicators in the Market Analysis Agent
2. Develop specialized risk models in the Risk Management Agent
3. Create custom reporting templates in the Reporting and Analytics Agent
4. Configure agent interaction patterns for complex trading workflows

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- API keys for cryptocurrency exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart_crypto_portfolio_manager.git
   cd smart_crypto_portfolio_manager
   ```

2. Configure the system:
   - Edit the configuration files in the `config/` directory
   - Set your API keys in `config/trade_execution.json`
   - Adjust risk parameters in `config/risk_management.json`

3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Docker Deployment

Each agent runs in its own Docker container, making deployment and scaling easy:

### Container Configuration

- **Market Analysis Agent**: Runs on port 8001
- **Trade Execution Agent**: Runs on port 8002
- **Risk Management Agent**: Runs on port 8003
- **Reporting and Analytics Agent**: Runs on port 8004

### Scaling

You can scale individual agents to handle higher loads:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --scale market-analysis-agent=3
```

### Monitoring

Monitor the system using standard Docker commands:

```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Development

### Project Structure

- `agents/`: Contains the implementation of each specialized agent
  - `market_analysis/`: Market Analysis Agent implementation
  - `trade_execution/`: Trade Execution Agent implementation
  - `risk_management/`: Risk Management Agent implementation
  - `reporting_analytics/`: Reporting and Analytics Agent implementation
- `a2a/`: Implementation of the Agent-to-Agent communication protocol
- `config/`: Configuration files for each agent
- `common/`: Shared utilities and code

### Adding New Agents

1. Create a new directory in `agents/`
2. Create an `agent.json` file defining the agent's capabilities
3. Implement the agent's functionality
4. Add the agent to `docker-compose.yml`

### Extending Agent Capabilities

1. Add new capability definitions to the agent's `agent.json` file
2. Implement the corresponding handler functions
3. Register the handlers in the agent's initialization

## API Documentation

Each agent exposes a RESTful API following the A2A protocol:

- **Agent Discovery**: `GET /api/v1/agent`
- **Task Management**:
  - Create Task: `POST /api/v1/tasks`
  - Get Task: `GET /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}`
  - Update Task: `PUT /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}`
  - Delete Task: `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}`
- **Messaging**:
  - Send Message: `POST /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/messages`
  - Get Messages: `GET /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/messages`

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in configuration files and never exposed in logs
- Communication between agents can be secured with TLS
- Authentication is required for task creation
- Risk limits prevent catastrophic trading errors
